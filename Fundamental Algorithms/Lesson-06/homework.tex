        \\ We want to find the successor of node $150$ on its left side (vertex $x$). We therefore search for the node with value $150$ and its left child is the successor, otherwise there is no successor.
        \\ To do this, the following Python code was implemented with the recursive function SuccessorVerbose.
        \\ Note that you can also implement the SUCCESSOR algorithm in an iterative way or by keeping track of the parent pointer, but this way is neater I think.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Heap property guarantees elements on higher levels are greater (for max-heap) than elements on lower levels.
    \item Binary Search property guarantees order, from "left" to "right".
    \item The heap property can print out the keys of an $n$-node tree in sorted order in $O(n\ log\ n)$. This is due to the fact that this property will require us to swap and reheapify each time so it would require $log(n) + log(n-1) + log(n-2) + ... + 1$ which results in $O(n\ log\ n)$.

\begin{quote}
In the novel I never wrote, I wanted the hero to be a computer programmer
because it was the most poetic and romantic occupation I could think
of [...] I conceived of him, whose professional life was spent in the
sanctum of the night (when, I was told, the computers, too valuable to be
unemployed by industry during the day, are free, as it were, to frolic)
devising idioms whereby problems might be fed to the machines and emerge,
under binary percussion, as the music of truth - I conceived of him as
being too fine, transluscent, and scrupulous to live in our coarse age.
He was to be, if the metaphor is biological, an evolutionary abortion,
a mammalian mutation crushed underfoot by dinosours, and, if the metaphor
is mathematical, a hypothetical ultimate, one digit beyond the last real
number.  The title of the book was to be $N+1$.
