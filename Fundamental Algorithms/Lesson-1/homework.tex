\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Let $A$ be a max-heap with heapsize fifty 
million, being used as a priority queue.  Suppose 
{\tt HEAP-INCREASE-KEY(A,300,key)} is called. What is the minimum & maximum number 
of exchanges that can take place?}}
    \\ The minimum number of exchanges is $0$ if the $key < A[300/2]$ (parent's key). 
    \\ The maximum number of exchanges occurs when $key$ is the largest key in the heap. 
    There would then be exchanges with $A[150]$, $A[75]$, $A[37]$, $A[18]$, $A[9]$, $A[4]$, $A[2]$ and $A[1]$.
    This is a total of $8$ exchanges.

\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{When $A$ is an array with length fifty 
million and {\tt MAX-HEAPIFY(A,300)} is called. What is the minimum & maximum 
number of exchanges that can take place?}}
    \\ The minimum number of exchanges is $0$ if the key at $300$ is bigger than the keys of both its children.
    \\ The maximum number of exchanges occurs when we have to work all the way down to the leaves.
    \\ We would have to exchange (Worst case) with $A[600]$, $A[1200]$, $A[2400]$, $A[4800]$, $A[9600]$, $A[19200]$, $A[38400]$, $A[76800]$, $A[153600]$, $A[307200]$, $A[614400]$, $A[1228800]$, $A[2457600]$, $A[4915200]$, $A[9830400]$, $A[19660800]$ and $A[39321600]$, so a total of $17$ exchanges (We chose the left side as indexes are smaller than on the right side).

\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Consider a min-heap $H$ with length $1023$
\footnote{Did you recognize $1023$ as a special number? It's one less 
than $1024=2^{10}$. The binary tree with that many nodes just fills 
out a row!}.
Assume the elements of the array are distinct. Let $x$ be the third 
smallest element in the array.}}
\\ \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{What are the possible positions for $x$.}}
    \\ It could be in any position in the first two rows, that is, from
    two to seven.
\\ \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Let $y=H[700]$. Can $y$ be the largest element in the array?}}
    \\ Yes because any leaf could be the largest in a min-heap.
\\ \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Can $y$ be the smallest element in the array?}}
    \\ No because the smallest in a min-heap is the root.
\\ \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Give all $i$ for which it is possible that $y$ is the $i$-th smallest element of the array.}}
    \\ Its ancestors ($350,175,87,43,21,10,5,2,1$) must be smaller
       so it can be at best tenth smallest.  Its descendents must be
       bigger but it doesn't have any descendents. These are the only
       conditions and it could be the $i$-th smallest for any 
       $10\leq i\leq 1023$.

\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Using the figures in the text as a model, illustrate the operation of
{\tt BUILD-MAX-HEAP} on the array $A=(5,3,17,10,84,19,6,22,9)$}}

\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{The operation {\tt HEAP-DELETE(A,t)} deletes the item in node $t$
from heap $A$.  Give an implementation of {\tt HEAP-DELETE} that runs in
$O(\lg n)$ time for an $n$-element max-heap.}}
    \\ First a simple case: If $t$ is $A.heapsize$ then simply decrement
    $A.heapsize$.  ELSE first reset $A[t]\leftarrow A[A.heapsize]$ and
    decrement $A.heapsize$.  Now you have the right elements but $A[t]$
    may be in the wrong places.  First check if $A[t]> A[parent[t]]$
    (Ignore this if $t$ is the root.)  If so, we have a WHILE loop,
    exchanging $A[t]$ and $A[parent[t]]$ and then resetting $t\leftarrow parent[t]$
    while $t$ is not the root and $A[t]> A[parent[t]]$. ELSE (that is, if
    we did not have $A[t]> A[parent[t]]$, then the only (possible) problem
    is that $A[t]$ is too small.  So we apply $MAX-HEAPIFY[A,t]$.

\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Let $A$ be an array of length $127$ in which the values are
distinct and in increasing order.  In the procedure 
{\tt BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)} precisely how many times will two elements
of the array be exchanged?}}
    \\ BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A) starts from I = LENGTH(A)/2 DOWN to 1, every I will 
    do Max-Heapify. \\ For $32\leq I\leq 63$ ,there should be one exchange.
    \\ For $16\leq I \leq 31$, there should be 2 exchanges. 
    \\ For $8\leq  I \leq 17$, there should be 3 exchanges. 
    \\ For $I=4,5,6,7$ , there should be 4 exchanges. 
    \\ For $I = 2,3$ there should be 5 exchanges. 
    \\ The root goes down to the bottom, 6 exchanges. 
    \\ Total: $32\cdot 1+16\cdot 2+8\cdot 3+4\cdot 4+2\cdot 5+1\cdot 6 = 120$
\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Now suppose the values are distinct and in decreasing order. Again, in the procedure 
{\tt BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)} precisely how many times will two elements
of the array be exchanged?}}
    \\ Never!  Each element will be placed originally in precisely its
    correct final spot.
