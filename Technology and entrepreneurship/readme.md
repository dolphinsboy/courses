### Successful startup
1. Start with good people
    - You want *animals*, passionate and addicted about their job
    - Three qualities:
        - Smart
        - Get things done
        - Bearable personality
    - Get them from a network of friends is great
    - Only business people as founders is bad as they don't know limitations and possibilities
    - Get **1** business person to focus on what customers want, although tech can do it as well.
2. Make something customers actually want
    - Look at something people are trying to do
    - Figure out how to do it in a way that does not suck
    - The idea is worth nothing without its people
    - Make an MVP ASAP
3. Spend as little money as possible
