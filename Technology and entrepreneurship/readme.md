### Summary
- How to start a startup, Paul Graham
   1. Start with good people
       - You want *animals*, passionate and addicted about their job
       - Three qualities:
           - Smart
           - Get things done
           - Bearable personality
       - Get them from a network of friends is great
       - Only business people as founders is bad as they don't know limitations and possibilities
       - Get **1** business person to focus on what customers want, although tech can do it as well.
   2. Make something customers actually want
       - Look at something people are trying to do
       - Figure out how to do it in a way that does not suck
       - The idea is worth nothing without its people
       - Make an MVP ASAP
   3. Spend as little money as possible
