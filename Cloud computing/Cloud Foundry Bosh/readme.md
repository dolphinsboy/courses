# Cloud computing: Assignment 1

## AWS SUSE 64 bit Linux instance

### Launching an instance

1. Log in (or sign up) on [https://console.aws.amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com)
1. Go to the [Amazon EC2 Launch Instance Wizard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/#LaunchInstanceWizard)
1. From the Quick Start tab, choose the `SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 (HVM), SSD Volume Type` **Amazon Machine Image** (*AMI*)

    [![Step 1: AMI choice](readme/suse/1.ami.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/#LaunchInstanceWizard)
    
1. Select **t2.micro** as the type and click on **Review and Launch**

    [![Step 2: Instance type](readme/suse/2.type.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/#LaunchInstanceWizard)
    
1. Launch the instance by clicking **Launch** from the EC2 LaunchWizard

### Connecting to it

1. Choose **Create a new key** and create a key. Keep the downloaded PEM private key file.
1. Make sure you have **ssh** installed on your machine
1. Check your running instances at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?#Instances](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/?#Instances) and wait for the instance to be in the **running** state.

    [![Running instances](readme/suse/4.ssh.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/#Instances)

1. To connect to your instance, enter the following in a terminal:

    ```bash
    ssh -i "/path/where/your/key/is/bosh.pem" ec2-user@xxx-00-000-000-00.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    ```

    Make sure to replace `xxx-00-000-000-00` with the public DNS IP of your instance.

    
## AWS, Bosh and Cloud Foundry

### Domain

1. Register a domain somehow, say `example.com`
1. Go to the [Amazon Route 53 Hosted Zones](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?#hosted-zones:)
1. Click on *Create Hosted Zone* twice
1. On the right pane, fill in the following information:
    - Domain name: `example.com`
    - Type: `Public Hosted Zone`
1. From your domain registrar, delegate DNS authority for your hosted zone to your four Amazon Route 53 name servers. To do this, replace your registrarâ€™s NS records for the domain with the NS record values you created in the last step.

### IAM bbl-policy

1. Create a new policy at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies$new?step=edit](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies$new?step=edit)
1. Click on *JSON* then paste the following content in the text field. Finally click *Review policy*.

    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ec2:*",
                    "cloudformation:*",
                    "elasticloadbalancing:*",
                    "iam:*",
                    "route53:*",
                    "logs:*",
                    "kms:*"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "*"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. On the [Review page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies$new?step=review), enter the name `bbl-policy` and click on *Create policy*

### IAM bbl-user

1. Click on [this link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/users$new?step=details&accessKey&userNames=bbl-user) to start creating a user `bbl-user` with programmatic access. Click on *Next: Permissions*
1. Click on *Attach existing policies*, search for `bbl-policy` and select it. Click on *Next: Review*
1. Click on *Create user*
1. Note the **Access key ID** and the **Secret access key** (click on *Show*)

### Development VM

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) installed on your machine to run the virtual machine.
1. With a terminal, go to the directory where the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is located and enter:

    ```bash
    sudo docker build -t boshaws ./
    sudo docker run -it --rm boshaws
    ```
    
This virtual machine contains the following tools:
- Terraform
- Bosh CLI 2
- Bosh Bootloader for Cloud Foundry
- Cloud Foundry CLI
- All necessary compilation tools (gcc, ruby, etc.)

### Bosh infrastructure

1. In the Docker VM, create the infrastructure and deploy a Bosh Director with the following commands. 
    In all the next commands, replace YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID, YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY and YOUR-AWS-REGION.

    ```bash
    bbl plan --iaas aws --aws-access-key-id YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID --aws-secret-access-key YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY --aws-region YOUR-AWS-REGION
    bbl up --aws-access-key-id YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID --aws-secret-access-key YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY
    ```
    
1. Export environment variables generated with:

    ```bash
    eval "$(bbl print-env)"
    ```
   
You can delete the Bosh Director infrastructure with:

```bash
bbl destroy --aws-access-key-id YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-ID --aws-secret-access-key YOUR-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY
```

### Cloud Foundry

1. Clone the repository with:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment.git && cd cf-deployment
    ```

1. Check you can log in to your BOSH Director with:

    ```bash
    bosh log-in
    ```
    
1. Check the last line of *cf-deployment.yml*:

    ```bash
    tail -1 cf-deployment.yml
    ```
    
    Note the version number, say it is `3541.2`.
    
1. Upload the corresponding stemcell with (make sure it's the same version !):

    ```bash
    bosh upload-stemcell https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3541.2
    ```
    
1. Deploy with:

    ```bash
    bosh -d cf deploy cf-deployment/cf-deployment.yml
    ```
